      <ol>
        <li>Develop and Support Open-Source Projects</li>
        <p>Open-source software focuses on sharing resources and knowledge rather than owning or restricting access to them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promote collaboration:</li>
          <p>Open-source projects encourage collaboration across global communities and allow for shared ownership. This helps decentralize control over digital infrastructure.</p>
          <li>Transparent development:</li>
          <p>Open-source platforms are transparent and accessible, which helps to reduce inequalities in the tech industry. We contribute to projects that have a clear vision of equality and non-proprietary control.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Create Decentralized Platforms</li>
        <p>With a reduction in the centralized control of economic, intellectual, or digital resources, we can create or support decentralized web platforms that reduce control over resources owned/controlled by corporations or governments.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decentralized finance (DeFi):</li>
          <p>Web developers can build decentralized financial systems that eliminate traditional banks, providing more equitable access to resources and services. Platforms that implement peer-to-peer lending or cooperative investment can reduce wealth disparities.</p>
          <li>Decentralized social networks:</li>
          <p>We encourage users to control their own data. Developers can create decentralized social networks that encourage autonomy.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Promote Digital Commons</li>
        <p>Web developers can work on platforms that are designed to be non-proprietary and community-owned, redistributing digital resources with a equitable practices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creative Commons Licensing:</li>
          <p>Developers can integrate tools that encourage Creative Commons licenses for digital content (such as images, videos, and music). This enables the free sharing and remixing of creative works while ensuring that authors maintain attribution.</p>
          <li>Knowledge-sharing platforms:</li>
          <p>Developers can create platforms that encourage the collective sharing of knowledge and resources helping to break down the class barriers to access to information.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Support Cooperative Business Models</li>
        <p>We can build tools and platforms that support cooperative models where all members have ownership and decision-making power, rather than profits flowing to a few shareholders.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worker-owned software platforms:</li>
          <p>Developers can contribute to or create software that allows for the formation of worker cooperatives—businesses owned and managed by the workers.</p>
          <li>Co-op marketplaces:</li>
          <p>Develop Cooperative marketplaces where products or services are produced and sold by cooperatives.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Build Platforms for Collective Action</li>
        <p>Collective action is a key part of dismantling hierarchical structures. We can create tools that make it easier for people to organize and push for systemic change.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital organizing tools:</li>
          <p>Develop platforms that help activists and communities organize protests, petitions, mutual aid networks, or local movements.</p>
          <li>Crowdsourcing and collective problem-solving:</li>
          <p>Build platforms that harness collective intelligence to solve social or economic problems. This ties back to previous points of decentralized social platforms, allowing for collaboration for social innovation, crowdsourced research, or crowd-funded social projects that directly benefit underrepresented communities.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Focus on Privacy and User Autonomy</li>
        <p>Privacy is a fundamental component of classless societies, as it protects individuals from the surveillance and exploitation that often accompany capitalist systems.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data privacy tools:</li>
          <p>Developers can create and implement tools such as private browsing, decentralized storage, and message encryption to allow individuals control over their data.  Users having control over their personal data and being able to opt in or out of data-sharing practices can further reduce the credit card of our personal information held by corporations.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Promote Ethical Business Practices</li>
        <p>Developers can choose to work for or build businesses that prioritize ethical practices, including equitable distribution of wealth, fair labor conditions, and transparency in operations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fair compensation models:</li>
          <p>Build or support platforms that facilitate fair compensation for workers. This could include transparent wage-sharing tools or platforms that make it easier to negotiate fair pay.</p>
          <li>Socially responsible business tools:</li>
          <p>Work on creating platforms that allow businesses to operate transparently, publish reports on their environmental and social impact, and give consumers the power to choose ethically produced goods and services.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Support Tech for Social Justice</li>
        <p>Web developers can use their skills to create tech that actively supports social justice movements—particularly those that challenge systemic inequalities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nonprofit and advocacy platforms:</li>
          <p>Develop websites and tools for nonprofits or social justice organizations that work on economic inequality, workers' rights, or climate justice. These tools can help advocate for policy change or assist in mobilizing people to take action.</p>
          <li>AI and fairness:</li>
          <p>Developers working with AI can prioritize fairness and equality in their algorithms to ensure that these technologies don’t reinforce existing class structures or biases. Building systems that are designed to reduce discrimination can help dismantle class and racial inequities in digital spaces.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Redesign Work Platforms for Greater Equity</li>
        <p>Many web platforms often exacerbate inequality and exploit workers. Developers can redesign platforms to make labor more equitable and fair.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worker-centric platforms:</li>
          <p>We can develop alternatives to exploitative platforms, such as Uber and TaskRabbit, where workers have more control in decision-making.</p>
          <li>Democratic governance in tech platforms:</li>
          <p>We can help build platforms, modeled on worker councils or community governance models, to allow for more democratic decision-making.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <span>Conclusion:</span><p>For web developers who believe in these values, the task is to build systems that don't just serve the powerful. We can contribute to a future where class distinctions are minimized, and resources are shared more equally.</p>
